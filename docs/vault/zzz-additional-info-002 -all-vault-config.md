In Vault, you can list all configurations and settings depending on the secrets engines, authentication methods, and paths you want to query. Hereâ€™s how you can approach listing various configurations:

------

### **1. List Authentication Methods**

To see all enabled authentication methods and their configurations:

```bash
vault auth list
```

#### Example Output:

```plaintext
Path           Type       Accessor              Description
----           ----       --------              -----------
azure/         azure      auth_azure_b1234567   Azure Authentication
token/         token      auth_token_d1234567   Token Authentication
```

#### View Specific Auth Method Configuration:

To view the configuration for an auth method (e.g., Azure):

```bash
vault read auth/azure/config
```

------

### **2. List Secrets Engines**

To see all enabled secrets engines and their configurations:

```bash
vault secrets list
```

#### Example Output:

```plaintext
Path            Type       Accessor              Description
----            ----       --------              -----------
azure/          azure      secret_azure_1234567  Azure Secrets Engine
kv/             kv         secret_kv_23456789    Key/Value Secrets Engine
```

#### View Specific Secrets Engine Configuration:

To view the configuration for a secrets engine (e.g., Azure):

```bash
vault read azure/config
```

------

### **3. List All Mounted Paths**

To see all enabled paths (both authentication and secrets engines):

```bash
vault list sys/mounts
```

#### Example Output:

```plaintext
Key              Type       Accessor              Options
----             ----       --------              -------
auth/azure/      azure      auth_azure_b1234567   {}
auth/token/      token      auth_token_d1234567   {}
secret/kv/       kv         secret_kv_23456789    {"version": "2"}
secret/azure/    azure      secret_azure_1234567  {}
```

------

### **4. List Policies**

To see all policies configured in Vault:

```bash
vault policy list
```

------

### **5. Debugging and System Information**

For more system-wide configurations:

- **View System Backend Mounts:**

  ```bash
  vault read sys/mounts
  ```

- **View System Configuration:**

  ```bash
  vault read sys/config/state/sanitized
  ```

------

### Notes:

- Vault does not have a single command to list all configurations across all paths at once. You'll need to explore individual paths for authentication, secrets engines, and other system settings.
- The `vault list` and `vault read` commands are key to navigating the configuration hierarchy.

Let me know which specific configuration you're looking for, and I can guide you further!
