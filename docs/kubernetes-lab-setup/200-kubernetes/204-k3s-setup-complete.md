# k3s Setup completed.



Congratulations you now have 2 Lightweight Clusters you can use for your Lab. 

What's next?

You can now attempt to perform the various tasks you want to experiment . 

Here are some projects that might be intersting

- [Pacman for k8s](https://github.com/saintdle/pacman-for-k8s)

- This game [DockerDoomd](https://github.com/gideonred/dockerdoomd) is packaged in a container. Try deploying this in the kubernetes cluster and accessing.
This will give you some ideas on how to deploy containers to Kubernetes.



I will be working on the next phase of lab setup for the Kubernetes applications. 
These are required services for any production cluster. 

Meanwhile check this out [CNCF applications for the various towers](https://landscape.cncf.io/)
